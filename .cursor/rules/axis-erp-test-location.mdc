# axis-erp Test Location

All axis-erp test files **must** live under the canonical test directory:

```
axis-erp/__tests__/
```

## Do

- Place new tests in `axis-erp/__tests__/`, mirroring the source structure
- Example: `selling/services/order-pricing.ts` → `__tests__/selling/services/order-pricing-service.test.ts`
- Use `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts` naming

## Don't

- Co-locate tests next to source (e.g. `selling/services/__tests__/`)
- Put tests in `axis-erp/` root or scattered subfolders

## Reference

- `axis-erp/vitest.config.ts` — includes `__tests__/**/*.{test,spec}.ts`
- `axis-erp/AGENT.md` — architecture and test layout
